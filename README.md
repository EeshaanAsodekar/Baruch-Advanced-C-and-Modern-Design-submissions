## Course Topics

### 1. C++11 Fundamentals
We introduce some of the most important and far-reaching functionality that C++11 offers, in particular the multi-paradigm approach to modeling functions. We also introduce functionality that improves the robustness and efficiency of C++ code.

- Lambda functionsâ€™ essential functionality, comparing lambda functions with function objects.
- Improving classes in C++11 (avoiding generation of special functions, move semantics, explicit constructors, no except).
- Variadic fundamentals and polymorphic behavior.
- Universal function wrappers and C++11 Bind.
- Function wrappers with Inheritance and Composition.
- Tuples A-Z, sealed classes, other class improvements (alias template, explicit override).

### 2. Advanced C++11 and C++14
We introduce advanced syntax and functionality in C++11 and C++14. The main focus is on functionality that promotes the reliability and robustness of C++ code.

- Introduction to type traits and Template Metaprogramming (TMP).
- Advanced type traits (e.g., creating type-independent code).
- Advanced lambda programming (e.g., init captures and functional programming in C++).
- Smart pointers in Boost and C++11.
- IEEE 754 and C++ Floating Point Classification.
- Platform-dependent and platform-independent error codes and error conditions.
- STL Bitset, Boost dynamic Bitset, and mini-applications.
- STL Function Objects and Lambdas.
- Variadic Template Programming.
- Multiparadigm Programming in C++.

### 3. C++ Libraries
We discuss how C++ supports multi-threading, concurrency, parallel, and network programming.

- Essentials of Boost and C++11 threading.
- Advanced C++ Concurrency, C++ Tasks, and tasking applications.
- New data structures and data types in C++11.
- STL algorithms in a multi-paradigm programming environment.
- Random numbers and statistical distributions.
- Network programming (TCP/UDP) and Boost Asio library (C++17).

### 4. Boost C++ Libraries
We give a thorough overview of the Boost C++ libraries to acquaint students with their potential and functionality.

- Boost Libraries Overview.
- String Algorithm Library.
- Regular expressions and Regex.
- Hash and Unordered, bitmap, heap, matrix libraries (Boost uBLAS).
- Signals and slots (Boost signals2).

### 5. System and Design Patterns
We discuss the popular design and system patterns that are based on the object-oriented model. We concentrate on approximately 20% of the patterns that account for 80% of the effectiveness in software development. We also show how to create next-generation patterns using the multi-paradigm programming models that C++11 supports.

- Class and Component diagrams in UML.
- Whole-Part pattern.
- Object-Oriented Metrics.
- Creational patterns, structural patterns, behavioral patterns.
- Next Generation Design Patterns.
- Examples and applications.

### 6. C++ Applications
We present a defined process (based on a combination of Structured Analysis, System patterns, and C++11) to architecting, design, and implementation of complex software systems.

- Locating and bounding the Software System.
- System Decomposition.
- Presentation Abstraction Control model.
- Policy-Based Design (PBD) in C++.
- Examples and applications.
- Principles of Parallel Programming and Libraries.
